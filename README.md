# Weather Project

This is a web application that gets your location data and passes that data to an express server. On the server, the server queries the Open Weather Map API database to access the weather data for each location. To use this project, Input the location you wish to search for the current weather on the input feild and click search to deiplay the current weather as well as humidity for the current location.

To build this project, you must first register an ccount with the Open Weather Map API at https://openweathermap.org/ and then place your API Key in the .env file.

# EJS/todoist-v1

This is a web appication that uses EJS for templatin as well as partials for components. The frontend gets and displays the current date & month at the top. Input feilds allows users to input any tasks they have for the given day. Users can also crossout any tasks that have been completed.

To build this project, users must first in stall any npm dependencies. Since we are using EJS to template our file, any additional pages can use header.ejs and footer.ejs found in the views folder to style the page quickly.
