This is a web application that gets your location data and passes that data to an express server. On the server, the server queries the Open Weather Map API database to access the weather data for each location. To use this project, Input the location you wish to search for the current weather on the input feild and click search to deiplay the current weather as well as humidity for the current location.

To build this project, you must first register an ccount with the Open Weather Map API at https://openweathermap.org/ and then place your API Key in the .env file.

This Project was made in partial fullfilment of the Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu from Udemy.com
